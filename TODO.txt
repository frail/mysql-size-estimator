basics:
------------------------------
* get test covarage to 90% at least and keep it there
* get rid of print(), a decent logging would be nice
* exception handling / custom exceptions
* should support partial index
* cli tests
* estimator tests
* estimator is not working properly, fixes on unicode logic is necessary
* index calculations is too simple, should be fixed for innodb at least (leafs etc)

features:
------------------------------
* beside dummy / file let the application connect to mysql and get table meta from there
* feature to sample data from source to guess data behavior (null field ratio / string field's length)
* overlapping index warning (?)
* myisam (or other engine) estimator (?)
